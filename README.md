# AppCodeDesign
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  This application had the goals of being able to add users to a database, as well as inventory. It was also to incorporate a UI that allowed the user to access the feautures of the application. The way these were implemeted was to ensure that screen progession flowed naturally with actions that the user would normally execute. I approached coding the application by focusing on the UI portions first and then focusing on the more logical processes of the app. These could be applied in the future by remembering to keep best coding practices and the knowlesge learned in this ocurse on mobile apps in the future. 
    The way that the application was tested was to use many different Try,Catch statements with the intent of finding erros in the code and troubleshooting faults that were present. The main area that needed innovation was the implementation of the database, which I ended up using try catch statements to allow the user access to the application in the case of a fault. The area I best demonstrated my knowledge is in the design of the UI, of which I spent a lot of time ensuring it was as well designed as possible.
